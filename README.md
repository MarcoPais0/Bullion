# Bullion

Bullion is a WebApp that simulates a cryptocurrency exchange, made as the **Final Project** for the [**CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

I believe this project is sufficiently distinct from all the projects made for this course because it is not too similar to any of those, eventhough it might have some features that are very similar to some features present in the other apps, for example, the login and register features. It is also seperated in two main apps, wich makes it a little more complex too.

The **complexity** is greater than all the other projects too because it involves the consuming of an API and the project has a big list of features.

This project also makes use of **4 Django Models** and a series of **JavaScript** files.

During all the **testing** done the **WebApp was mobile-responsive** allowing me to use all the features available in the app.

# Description

## Technologies Used

For this project I used **Python**, **Django**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

To retrieve all the information about the many cryptocurrencies in real time I used [Coin Gecko's API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) because it was easy to use, it has all the data the application needs, it has no request limit and no API key was needed.

To import the price charts I used [Trading View's Widget](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/advanced-chart/).

## Files

In this section I will not explain the various settings files and the irrelevant files like the ".css" or the ".png" files.

I also separated the Django Project in two separate apps, the "users" and the "exchange" apps.

- **static/css/styles.css**: this file contains all the styles for the various components of the WebApp pages.

- **static/img, static/logos**: these folders contain all the images used in the WebApp.

  - **favorite.js**: this script makes an API call to the application to add or remove a coin to an User's favorites list.
  - **markets.js**: this script loads the table for the markets page that displays the top 100 cryptocurrencies.
  - **search.js**: this script loads the search results on the search page everytime the input changes.
